## Busy Body

Busy Body is an RSS feed aggregator/reader built with React.js. It will pull in an RSS feed and display it using React. The project is hosted using github pages at [Busy Body](https://jamesandrews23.github.io/busy-body/)

## Interface

The interface was built with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/). Material-UI follows the material style of web design see [material.io](https://material.io). Material-UI has a great set of prebuilt components that incorporate easily into any React application. I used the card components for displaying the RSS snippet. 

## Storage

The Browser's LocalStorage is used to retain added RSS feeds.

## XML Parser

Check out this [XML to JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmltojsobjconverter) parser I created specifically for this project. It pulls in the XML document returned by the RSS feed and creates a JavaScript object from it. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
